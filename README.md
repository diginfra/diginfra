## Get started

Follow our [**quick start guide**](https://www.diginfra.khulnasoft.com/docs/#quick-start) to get started üöÄ

Diginfra also has many CI/CD integrations so you can easily post cost estimates in pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

#### Diginfra Cloud

[Diginfra Cloud](https://www.diginfra.khulnasoft.com/docs/diginfra_cloud/get_started/) is our SaaS product that builds on top of Diginfra open source and works with CI/CD integrations. It enables you to check for best practices such as using latest generation instance types or block storage, e.g. consider switching AWS gp2 volumes to gp3 as they are more performant and cheaper. Team leads, managers and FinOps practitioners can also setup [tagging policies](https://www.diginfra.khulnasoft.com/docs/diginfra_cloud/tagging_policies/) and [guardrails](https://www.diginfra.khulnasoft.com/docs/diginfra_cloud/guardrails/) to help guide the team.
